# Unsupervised_Package

You can use this file to run couple of functions implemented from scracth. This was an exercise that aimed to work with python enviroments.

You can use the notebook as a reference or clone the whole folder.

As a suggestion to avoide any possible error:

```sh
pip install pipenv
pipenv shell
pipenv install
```
